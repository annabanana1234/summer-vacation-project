<p> This summer I traveled to <b>Italy</b> with my family. We visited Rome, Florence, and finally, Venice. I loved the food and the people. It was sad because my older brothers could not come along which made it different from all the other trips. Instead we brought my grandmother and aunt. After the great Italy adventure I traveled to <b>Boston</b> with two of my friends. We were to visit my best friend who moved there about a year ago. It was the first time I traveled without my parents. 

<h3> Summer Work</h3> <img src="doggie.jpg">

<p> My summer involved many fun activities and travels but I also had to keep a job. I was hired at <a href="http://www.wagdogspa.com/"</a><b>Wag Dog Spa</b> <a/>where I bathed dogs. I absoluty love animals so this was a perfect fit. 
I also babysat a family. They had four kids- Bo, Madelyn, Katie Beth, and Ella. Our summer activities included cupcake wars, lots of hide and seek, and some good frozen yogurt almost everyweek. I loved being with these kids because they were so obeident but also so much fun.


<h3> What made it a great summer?</h3>

<p> In addition to all the fun places and things I did it was who I was with that made it so fun. I got to see my friend Skyler from Boston. I even got to visit with my two older brothers who I dont see as often. Joseph was off to Airforce training while Jacob co-oped in Tennesse at  <a href="http://www.eastman.com/Company/Worldwide/our_sites/Pages/UnitedStates_Tennessee.aspx"</a><b>Eastman Chemical</b>then set off to Canada to work on a farm. When we were all together it was the best. I made lots of new friends on my mission trip who I stayed in touch with as well.
